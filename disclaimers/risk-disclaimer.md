It is not a service of any kind and you should not rely on CRONEX.Finance to assist you to evaluate the Protocol, assess its fitness for any purpose or comply with any requirements. You assume all risks arising from interactions with the Protocol including without limitation all applicable legal and regulatory risks in connection with the use and interaction with the Protocol, including with respect to any transactions. Nothing stated relating to the Protocol is a prospectus nor a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. Nothing stated related to the Protocol constitutes a recommendation or advice of any kind. CRONEX.Finance is not liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, arising from, out of or in connection with the Protocol.

There are several risks when using the Protocol. These risks include inherent risks associated with the use of a virtual platform, the decentralized nature of the Protocol, and participating in virtual asset transactions. Risks include, without limitation:

{% hint style="danger" %}
* Partial or total loss of virtual assets, including any value attributed to virtual assets;
* Collapse in liquidity with respect to virtual assets;
* Changes in compatibility of a virtual asset with the Protocol;
* Changes in the smart contracts;

* Counter-party risk;
* Faults, defects, hacks, exploits, errors or unforeseen circumstances occurring in respect of the platform or the technologies that the Protocol depends on;

This list of potential risks is not exhaustive and is not intended to capture the extent of all possible risks. In the event of any of the above occurring, you may lose your virtual assets entirely.

Participants should use the Protocol at their own risk.&#x20;
