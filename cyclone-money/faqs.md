<summary>Why should I use CYCLONE?</summary>

CYCLONE makes your transfers anonymous. Snoopers cannot identify the source of your funds and helps maintain privacy of your main wallet or your CEX wallet. CYCLONE also helps you send anonymous assets to other wallets where your wallet is not revealed. The Relayer handles the transaction and your transaction will be mixed in a pool of similar transactions of same quantity, thereby making it impossible to identify your deposit or withdrawal.
