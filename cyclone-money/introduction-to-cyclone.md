# Introduction to CYCLONE

**CYCLONE Money** is a **fully decentralized** **non-custodial** **protocol** allowing private transactions in the Cronos Chain.

As a decentralized protocol, **CYCLONE Money** smart contracts have been implemented within the Cronos blockchain, making them immutable. They can neither be changed nor tampered with. Therefore, nobody - including the original developers - can modify or shut them down. All smart contracts are deployed by the community in a decentralized manner.

As a non-custodial protocol, users keep custody of their cryptocurrencies while operating **CYCLONE Money**. This means that at each deposit, they are provided with the private key enabling the access to the deposited funds, which gives users complete control over their assets.

## How is Privacy achieved?

**CYCLONE Money** improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts CRO & USDC deposits from one address and enables their withdrawal from a different address.

To maximize privacy, several steps are recommended, such as the use of a relayer for gas payments to withdraw funds from an address with no pre-existing balance.
