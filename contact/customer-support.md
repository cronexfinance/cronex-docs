# Customer Support

As a decentralized exchange, CRONEX.Finance offers no Customer Support to any user. Our offerings are automated and immutable by any agents. Therefore it nullifies any effort to provide any type of intervention by any Team member.

If you're experiencing issue, you can always:

{% hint style="info" %}
* Ask in our social media/groups for assistance.
* Contact the respective Token Developers/Team for assistance.
* Email us at feedback@cronex.finance
{% endhint %}
